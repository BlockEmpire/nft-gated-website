## Installation

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/index.js` and `src/App.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.js`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `src/App.js`, you'll find the `useMetamask` hook that we use to connect the user's wallet to MetaMask, `useDisconnect` that we use to disconnect it, and `useAddress` to check the user's wallet address once connected.
